"""This package's view of a ``sources`` catalog row.

The SDK hands back rows and deliberately picks no structure for them
(biopb/biopb#1032): ``query_sources`` answers in whichever format you ask for,
``resolve`` returns the one row it just wrote, and choosing what to decode them
into is the caller's job. This module is that choice, made once for this package.

Attributes rather than dict keys because the consumer is a Qt widget: the tree
builder, the residency badge and the resolve/warm branches read these fields
across a few hundred lines, and ``src.source_url`` survives a typo where
``src["source_url"]`` does not. Frozen because the widget's ``SourceList``
is rebound wholesale from a watcher thread and read on the Qt main thread -- the
snapshot is shared, so nothing may mutate an entry in place.

Only the structural fields are carried, because that is all a row has: the
transfer grid, pyramid, physical scale and source metadata are answered by
GetFlightInfo against a bound tensor (biopb/biopb#812), never by a listing.
