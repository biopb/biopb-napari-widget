    napari builds a layer's thumbnail from the origin slice but renders the

    ``ViewerModel._add_layer_from_data`` -> ``dims._go_to_center_step()``. For a
    tensor with non-spatial axes (channel/time) those are two *different*
    slices, so loading one layer materializes two coarse planes. With a source
    that has no native pyramid (e.g. nd2), each such plane is a full-resolution
    server-side decode, so the redundant center slice roughly doubles cold load
    time. Pinning the initial view to the origin makes the displayed slice
    coincide with the thumbnail slice -> one decode instead of two.

    Trade-off: the default view sits at index 0 on the sliced axes (e.g. the
    first channel / first Z) rather than the middle. ``_go_to_center_step`` only
    runs for the first layer, so this is a no-op for subsequent adds.

    The server advertises ``[..., Z, Y, X, S]``, so X and Y are read off the

    interleaved colour (label ``S``/``samples`` gated on a size of 3 or 4, so a

    Unlabeled ``dimN`` stores (plain zarr, HDF5) are the case the contract

    Why this matters: the server folds its downsample plan onto the descriptor
    (``scale_hint`` *and* ``reduction_method`` per level) and pre-warms exactly
    those chunk_ids. If the client builds its own ``scale_hint`` and omits the
    reduction, the server falls back to a *different* default (e.g. ``nearest``
    vs the advertised ``area``), so the client's chunk_ids never match the
    pre-warmed ones and every first load pays a full cold read. Honoring the
    advertised levels keeps the client's requests byte-identical to what the
    server serves and precaches.

    The lean catalog row carries no pyramid -- it
    is filled only at open time (``get_flight_info``) -- so when the passed
    *tensor_desc* lacks one, fetch the open-time descriptor once via
    ``get_descriptor``. That fetch is a **describe** (biopb/biopb#563): it asks
    for the pyramid (``with_pyramid=True``) but not the O(chunks) read plan (the
    default ``with_read_plan=False``) nor the heavy OME tree (``with_metadata``
    defaults False) -- so learning the levels no longer builds and discards a

    The levels are the server's, always. Each is requested by its advertised
    ``scale_hint`` *and* ``reduction_method`` (see
    :func:`_advertised_pyramid_levels`) so the client's chunk_ids match what the
    server serves and pre-warms.

    **When the server advertises none, this loads level 0 and stops.** There used
    to be a config-driven plan here that recomputed the ladder client-side. It
    drifted: the server moved to XY-only rungs plus one 3-D rung against a
    separate plane cap, while this still scaled X, Y and Z together against a
    single voxel budget, and it omitted ``reduction_method`` so its chunk_ids
    could not match a pre-warmed level anyway. A second, contradictory statement
    of a policy that is the server's to make is worse than no statement: the
    server has advertised a pyramid for every tensor since biopb/biopb#826, so
    the fallback was unreachable in practice and wrong wherever it did fire.

    Full resolution is the honest fallback. An old server that advertises nothing
    is also one that pre-warms nothing, so a client-computed coarse level would
    cost the same read as level 0 and deliver a blurrier picture -- measured, see
    ``chunk.compute_pyramid_scale_hints``.

    **Output axis order.** napari displays the *last* ndisplay axes by position
    and ignores ``dim_labels`` for layout, so a mis-ordered source (``[Y, X, C]``,
    a buried Z, swapped X/Y) would render the wrong plane silently. The order is
    the data plane's guarantee, not this function's job: it advertises
    ``[..., Z, Y, X, S]`` (biopb/biopb#596), so the levels arrive in display
    order and **no axis work happens here at all** -- nothing is transposed, and
    the rank is the source's.

    In particular a tensor with no Z does *not* get a singleton one inserted.
    That used to happen so ``build_layer_scale`` could write physical sizes to
    fixed trailing slots, but it made every layer disagree in rank with its
    source -- so ``layer.ndim`` had to be reasoned about separately from the
    descriptor, a 2-D image round-tripped through the OME-Zarr writer gained a
    phantom Z, and the agent guide needed a trap for the offset. The scale is
    placed by axis index instead, and the layer is now exactly the source array.

    """Build a tensor's pyramid and add it to *viewer* as an image layer.

    The shared "load a tensor into the viewer" pipeline used by both the Tensor
    Browser widget and the MCP ``add_tensor``: build pyramid levels (in napari's
    ``[..., Z, Y, X]`` display order, or ``[..., Z, Y, X, S]`` plus ``rgb=True``
    for interleaved colour), pin their slice
    reads to a single-process scheduler so the serial viewer shares the
    main-process chunk cache (issue #8; no-op standalone), attach the source's
    OME physical pixel size as ``scale`` + ``metadata['ome_physical_size']`` so
    the agent's areas/volumes come out in physical units, attach the
    canonicalized axis names as ``metadata['dim_labels']`` (the only way a
    writer, which sees just ``(path, data, meta)``, can name the axes) and the
    originating ``metadata['array_id']``, then ``add_image``
    (``multiscale=True`` when there is more than one level).

    **A label set becomes a ``Labels`` layer**, not an image one. The set is an
    ordinary tensor and its ``array_id`` is the only thing that says so
    (``<image array_id>/@labels/<name>``), so the decision is made here rather
    than at each call site -- the Tensor Browser and the MCP ``add_tensor``
    would otherwise have to agree about it separately. Everything up to the add
    is the same pipeline; what differs is the colour model and that the levels
    are first aligned onto the image's axes (:func:`align_label_levels`).
    Nothing is added implicitly: a set is a layer only when it is asked for.

    Source resolution, layer *name*, and any cursor/logging/error handling stay
    with the caller; everything from building levels through the add is uniform
    here so the three call sites can't drift.

    Returns the created napari layer.
