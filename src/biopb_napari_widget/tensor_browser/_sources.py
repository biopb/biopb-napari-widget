"""The catalog as the Tensor Browser shows it, and what keeps it current.

Qt-free, so it runs and tests without a display. It reads through the shared
:class:`biopb.tensor.Connection` and holds the one cache in the picture: the
list of sources the tree is drawn from.

Threading: the watcher re-lists from its own daemon thread and only ever
*rebinds* ``sources`` to a fresh dict, so a reader on the Qt thread sees the
whole old list or the whole new one.
