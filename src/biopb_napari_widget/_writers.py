"""GUI-free OME-Zarr writers for this napari plugin.

Registered as ``contributions.writers`` in ``napari.yaml`` so that
File -> Save Selected Layer(s) can persist a napari image/labels layer to a
local, standalone OME-Zarr directory with **no extra install**: ``ome-zarr``
(ome-zarr-py) and ``zarr`` already ship transitively via ``biopb[tensor]`` (and
``ome-zarr`` is a direct dependency of this package).

This module imports neither Qt nor napari, consistent with the package's
GUI-free rule (see ``__init__.py``): napari calls these functions with
plain ``(path, data, meta)`` values, so only numpy/zarr/ome_zarr are needed. The
heavy imports are function-local so importing this module stays cheap.

The OME metadata (multiscales axis typing) mirrors the biopb tensor server's
``_build_minimal_ome_metadata`` (``biopb_tensor_server.serving.server``) so the output
round-trips through the server's ``OmeZarrAdapter``, which derives ``dim_labels``
from ``multiscales[0].axes[*].name``.

Both image and labels layers are written as a **top-level** OME-Zarr image with
the layer's dtype preserved (integer for masks). This is simpler than the OME
spec's nested ``labels/<name>`` group and is exactly what loads back as a
first-class browsable source through ``OmeZarrAdapter``.

MULTISCALE: a napari *multiscale* layer already holds a resolution pyramid (the
Tensor Browser / ``add_tensor`` build one via ``_tensor_utils.build_pyramid_levels``).
We persist those levels as-is -- one OME-Zarr dataset per level -- so the saved
copy keeps its overviews and round-trips as a *native* pyramid through
``OmeZarrAdapter`` (which reads each level's NGFF ``scale`` as an integer
downsample factor). We never *synthesize* a pyramid: a single-resolution layer
stays single-resolution, and the per-level arrays are written exactly as napari
holds them (downsampled upstream with a label-safe reduction, so labels stay
integer-exact without any work here).

FUTURE EXTENSION POINT: the preferred next format is NDTiff (not OME-TIFF). To
add it, register a new command + writer entry in ``napari.yaml`` pointing at a
``write_*_ndtiff`` function here, reusing the ``_derive_axes`` helper below.
